# Brick Breaker Game

Brick Breaker is a simple Java-based 2D arcade game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game ends when the player clears all the bricks or loses the ball.

## Features

- Responsive gameplay with paddle movement and ball physics
- Multiple rows and columns of bricks to break
- Tracks the player's score
- Displays "Game Over" or "You Won" messages with options to restart
- Clean and simple user interface using **Swing** for graphics

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Swing**: For graphical user interface (GUI) elements
- **AWT**: For rendering 2D graphics

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Java Development Kit (**JDK**) 8 or higher
- Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
- A terminal/command prompt for compilation and execution

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parth-243/Java-Project-Simple-Brick-breaker-game-.git
cd brick-breaker-game/src
```

2. **Compile the code**: Run the following command in the `src` directory:

```bash
javac *.java
```

3. **Run the game**:

```bash
java App
```

4. Alternatively, open the project in an IDE and run the `App` class.

## How to Play

1. Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to move the paddle
2. Bounce the ball to break bricks
3. Earn **5 points** for every brick you break
4. The game ends when:
   - You clear all the bricks (win)
   - The ball falls below the paddle (game over)

## Controls

Key Action
`‚Üê` Move paddle left
`‚Üí` Move paddle right
`Enter` Restart the game

## Game Rules

1. The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks
2. If the ball hits the paddle, its direction changes based on where it lands
3. Breaking all the bricks wins the game
4. If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends
